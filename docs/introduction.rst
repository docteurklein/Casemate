Why Casemate ?
==============


Casemate is born from a common need of displaying content blocks into a website.
The well known pattern of blocks is retrieved in many content management frameworks
like Sympal, Diem, sonata's PageBundle, ...

Casemate goals are to provide an extremly flexible block system that will help you
to build content-oriented-but-not-only applications.


What is Casemate ?
==================

Casemate is built on top of Doctrine MongoDB ODM and Symfony2.
Casemate is based on bundles that provide block types.
Each block type offers a way to enter content and display this content, whereever the source comes from.

Currently it provides :doc:`blocks`.
