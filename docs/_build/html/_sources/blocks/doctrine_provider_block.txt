The doctrine provider block type
=====================

The ``DoctrineProviderBlockType`` is aimed to list and display content coming from the database.

It currently supports the listing and the detail of a doctrine ODM source.

Future goals are to abstract enough to handle any source
implementing ``Doctrine\Common`` ObjectRepository, like Doctine ORM or PHPCR ODM.
