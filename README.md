## Casemate

Casemate is built on top of Doctrine ODM and Symfony2.  
Casemate is based on bundles that provide block types.  
Each block type offers a way to enter content and display this content, whereever the source comes from.  


Documentation is available [here](silex-doctrine-extensions.rtfd.org).
